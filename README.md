# Reservio
I developed a booking application in French using React Native, React.js, and Nest.js. Leveraged GitLab for version control, Docker for containerization, Prisma for ORM, and PostgreSQL for database management.

It caters to industries like healthcare, wellness, education, and events, offering features such as customizable booking pages, automated reminders, and staff resource management.
